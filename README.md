# LIVE DEMO [insert link](insert link)

This is a solo project from the 'API and Async JavaScript' course of the coding school Scrimba. The assignment was to build a movie watchlist app based on a [design in figma](https://www.figma.com/design/jhFRdFIdHpRxsDznNXtpXw/Movie-Watchlist?node-id=2-17&t=cDhhywqdLTSelCE3-0).
It's using the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data.

## Requirements:

- Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html
- Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results.
- Button to "add to watchlist" which saves that data to local storage.
- Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage.
